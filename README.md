# object_detection_simulation

A simple simulation enviroment of one person and iris drone with downward looking camera. To use it make sure you have the following:
1) **PX4 avoidane:** I only use this to plan a path to the person model in gazebo world
2) **PX4 Firmware:** to get the iris drone model and to use the avoidance package
3) **darknet_ros:** to run yolo NN for object detection
4) **Tarek's object localization pakage**.
